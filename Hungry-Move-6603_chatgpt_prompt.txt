Everyone is something in LKO
Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes. I have hardly seen a car which does not have a sticker on it - everyone is uttar pradesh sarkar, adhiwakta, nyay palika, mahamantri, skoda laura, adrak lsson. 


What is the obsession peeps.

Scam.

Malls are a thing of past - and entire LKO is on steroids in rents cost, despite low to no demand.

I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go.

He was not a common man. He was their agent and shield. If I or anyone recorded myself handing out money, it would be to a common man, not cops directly.

Cops keep a civ around to discuss bribes.

Toh hum Noida or Ghaziabad se pahadio ko bhagana shuru karein fir? ðŸ˜‚ Bhukmari ajaegi

A menu easy to cook/process - healthy and quick.

Haha Delhi is hateable too but mostly those are HR or UP14 NCR vehicle. Plus the percentage of vehicles of such sort is low.

Its about the volume/%. The number of cars having these stickers is way too high compared to Delhi, or anywhere else.

Never seen anything of this sort in capital city of India. So yes I did not expect ðŸ¤ª

Dont you have big muscle brothers or friends? or cop/lawyer friends? My hands are always itching to teach a lesson to such people.

Same problem. I started eating power meals at home atleast saves me from crap quality. I even purchased a 250 per meal tiffin and it had palm oil!!!

Below Average.
